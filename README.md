___________________________________________

This code (along with the device in development) is meant to replicate and impove on the CHAD device which is explained in the below webpage and paper. 
    Paper: https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/jhab/article/id/13028/ 
    Webpage: https://web.archive.org/web/20181104190922/http://www.physi.cz:80/chad.html. The website has since been archived and is only accessable through a 'wayback machine'. 
    Original CHAD code from the Webpage is found in the folfed named 'Files from OG CHAD Webpage'

The goal of CHAD2.0 project is to point a device, such as a camera, at a desired target and copensate in real time for movent of the object or rotation of the balloon. This is acomplished by adding a second degree of freedom to the original CHAD device to allow both Yaw and Pitch control of a camera.
